# hello-world
Test 

I'm Vee of Earth. I'll give a paragraph or two about my experience with coding from the beginning. The very first encounter I had with code was in the early days of Myspace. You could alter profiles with HTML, and so I learned how to <b> do this by doing that.</b> The first language proper that I learned was C++ in high school. I never used it again, as I just couldn't stand it for reasons I still don't understand. It turned me off to coding for years.

Later though, in my early 20's, the advent of creations like the Pi and Arduino brought me back around. I then learned Python to an intermediate level, just for the recreation. Still, all I learned felt forced, and I didn't believe myself capable of creating something new, or unique, or useful. Another thing I was interested in at the time, was reading the speeches given by JFK during his presidency, and the site that housed all the original PDF scans had a terrible system for accessing and saving each one. This was my Eureka moment, when the learning I had done paid off. A problem arose from a completely organic situation, and I had the capability to solve it through code - or, at least I hoped could do it.

Sure enough, 10-20 lines of code later, I'd written something completely my own, from scratch, with no googling or tutorial seeking. The program accessed the source files I was after by scanning through a given set of web addresses, seeking any file it could locate that was a PDF. It then labeled them by a unique name and number, and saved them to a new folder on my desktop. This success created a feeling in me that I'd never experienced until that point - and I've never stopped learning code of different types since.

Currently, and for the better part of the past 5 years, I've been compelled to make my own game. To do this, I've been using Game Maker Studio (and still using it until I can afford to upgrade to GMS2!), and through that software I have gained a genuine love for the art of creating through code. Only now have I begun to realize the potential utility (and even basic concept) of Github. It's been something I've been meaning to get around to learning for a long time, as I may be one of the only people in the world who doesn't use it at this point in time. So, here I am, looking to learn more, just as I said. 

Not sure why I even wrote this. I didn't mean to, it just happened. Maybe my daughter will be a programmer of some sort one day, and she'll find this interesting to read. 

And in the off case you're reading this 20 years down the road, kiddo - Daddy loves you so much. I hope I've made something worth making between then and now, something you love as much as you love Smash and Cuphead now at age 5. I thought I wanted to make a game for me when I started, and maybe I did. But, now, I want to make a game for you - and even if it never gets known beyond our own family - I hope it can bring you joy, and if I'm lucky, some inspiration - like you do for me every day. And Non - I love you. Thanks for being here for me all these years, and high five for this magical child we both made. If we're not married by now...well, I better come up with the excuse of all excuses ever excused for an offense that grievous. You'll always have my heart, the both of you - and again, I love you.

Sincerely,
-Vee
